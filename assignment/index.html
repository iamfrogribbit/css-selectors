            <h2>This blog post is highlighted because I wish to burn your eyes</h2>
            <p>This is a highlighted paragraph, you might ask yourself, Riley</p>
            <p class="highlightexception">Why is this line not highlighted?</p>
            <p>The answer:</p>
            <br />
            <p class="quote">Because I wish it not to be. Therefore I have highlighted every paragraph under this heading using 'h2 ~ p'
            but have excepted that line by giving it the class attribut: "highlightexception" and set it to a normal sentence</p>
            <br />
            <p>But Riley, is this the most efficient way to except a single line from being highlighted?</p>
            <br />
            <p class="quote">To that my child I would answer</p>
            <br />
            <p class="highlightexception"><span class="highlight">I have not a clue.</span></p>
